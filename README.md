Here is a collection that shows my skills as a software engineer.
All that you see is me trying to do something that have me interested at the time, and some coding challenges that I have tried.
## A bit of rant
While being interviews I have noted that most companies like to run a few coding tests. Mostly nothing that interesting as is just, basic problem solving and "optimization" problems. 
*At least the one I have seen.*

My problems with these tests are the time limit! As an experienced software developer, I know that rushing a solution is not just a bad practice but pure stupid.

More than that, I am dyslexic and cannot read as fast as average people, so having 10 min to answer 10 questions, where it takes me 30 second to read each question does not show my capabilities.

So, I have created this repository, so you can see what I can do and I have source control over my stupid ideas.

### Sudoku solver
This is something that I had done a few years ago in java. Don't really know what happened to it.

Around a year ago I got inspired by watching a Computerphile video. So, I decided to give it a try. It was also the perfect test, that could show me how good python actually was. (I was new to python at the time)

At the moment I'm warming my self up for AI development. And a sudoku board is a good matrix to traverse. This is the reason my `isPossible` function is so over engineered.

However I think I can make it completely branchless, not that it matters though, but meh!

I also wanted to try to visualize it using P5js but I donâ€™t think it will work. This is due to the way the function works, I think I need to solve it using a tabulation or with more traditional patterns.
