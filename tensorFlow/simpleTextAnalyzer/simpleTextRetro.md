# Simple Text Analyzer Retrospective

## TL; DR
In short, I am disappointed! Was hoping for more, wanted to use Tensorflow, wanted to put my hand on some Machine learning. But it turns out that there is no need for that. 

I will return to this later, and I would like to try my hypothesis about feeding in a book, and extending model data.

But for now, this is it.

## Summary
For the past few weeks, I have been doing extensive research on Artificial Intelligence, neural network, graph theory and linear algebra. (today is April the 10:th 2021).


I have a problem, that I must understand every single bit of the tool I use! And it turns out that I have been ignorant about this part of software engineering.      

For instance, only a month ago I realized the difference between GPU and CPU. 

I have always had a firm grasp on what a CPU is, all the way from a not gate to full adder to registers to the cash. But GPUs; well if you asked me what it was, I would have just said: "it is just like a CPU, but it works differently and, in some cases, it is faster …" 

Today, I say to myself: yeah sure. Do you even know how many cores a GPU have and what is its clock speed? 

This past month I have learned a lot, and I wanted to use my recently found skills. So why not a chat bot, that would be fun. I can create a language classification system that I can train using tensor. And if I know the intent of the request, I could make a response. 

So, I looked around for a basic tutorial, I found a 
[playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLzMcBGfZo4-ndH9FoC4YWHGXG5RZekt-Q)
created by Tech with Tim.

I have seen some of Tim’s videos, on free code camp. 

After watching the first three videos, I had an idea how to extract the data and categorize it. So, I stopped and went to get that part ready.

After I had the data structure as I wanted it, I finish the playlist, took another look at Tim’s code, and realized that the data structure between my code and his was way off. 

As I was figuring out the difference, I kept asking myself why I cannot use my data structure? 

While I was playing around with the idea and the data, I realized that I could solve the problem with pure statistics. 

And the rest is in the notebook…

## Retrospective
Even though I was disappointed, I cannot stop think about how I could solve this problem with pure statistics. 

I do not know but I have not seen anyone solve this problem using this method, the method is most likely in efficient. But it does what it needs to do, and it is quite a small program too. Not to mention that 80% of the program is preparing the data to be fed into the training model anyways.

The solution should have an $O = n^{2~or~3}$ because we are working with matrices and cubes. But again, after the training the run time should be based on the number of words in a sentence.

I always knew that text categorization and chat bots are quite simple compared to image recognition, voice synthesizers/recognizes or real-world simulations.

I do not know, I am disappointed.
